Captian: We finally captured her. It took us months. And we didn't come out of it unscathed.

General David: I heard she put up a fight. Little, but viscous.

Captain: David, you should know, Ryan, he's dead, she killed him.

General David: She what...

[END]

There was a girl, she didn't seem to know where she was born, which is normal, most people are too young to know the details surrounding their birth. When asked she was unable to recollect the names of her parents, but even more surprising she was unable to recollect ever having had parents, or even being raised. This alone raised questions. However, the girl later stated not having a name, nor having any knowledge of her actual age. The complete lack of information surrounding this individual was freightening and a great cause for concern, we really couldn't tell for sure wether or not she was lying, especially since she had been convicted of several crimes at the same time. She claimed that she had no reason to lie, and showed no fear in the face of death. We later asked her if she had any friends or family to speak of. 

We searched for anyone who would be able to confirm or deny anything she said, friend's or family who we could go to for more questions. She told us that she had one friend, and one friend alone, and that they both lived in Lithia, the poorest and most dangerous city in all of Zalel. Her only friend was a fellow orphin named Mikaelle. But he had been executed by the royal guard for evading capture and for generally being a criminal. The final verdict was to send the girl to the gallows, but a General named David stopped the execution and argued for something different.

That General happened to be me.

David

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


When it all started it was like being born for the first time. I had no idea where I was, or what I was doing. I couldn't remember anything past yesterday. Or maybe, today was yesterday. None of it made sense starting out. 

My head was pulsating with pain, it was like I was hit with a sledgehammer. I couldn't think clearly.

 I was oblivious to my surroundings, I couldn't tell where I was exactly. Everything seemed to materialize from nothing.

Despite having no memory of anything at all, I had the strange urge to do things, to follow routines I didn't know about. I felt compelled to exercise, and repeat certain phrases. Perhaps these were habits of mine in a different life.

As my surroundings materialized I noticed my reflection on the glass. A little red headed girl with blue eyes that almost seemed to glow, that's who I appeared to be. When I looked closer at my reflection I noticed a tatoo on the back of my neck, it was some sort of inscription with numbers.

I look up, and through the glass I see a woman, it was the first human I layed eyes on. I decided to open the door to the store I was standing outside of, and then have a conversation with the woman inside.

"Excuse me ma'am, can you help me? I seem to be a little lost and confused," I asked the woman with a small smile on my face.

The woman turned around, and her eyes widened slightly when she saw me. "Oh my goodness, you're just a child," she exclaimed, looking me up and down with concern.

I frowned slightly, feeling a little insulted. "I may be young, but I'm not a child," I retorted, crossing my arms over my chest.

The woman held up her hands in a placating gesture. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. What can I help you with?"

I gestured to the tattoo on the back of my neck. "Do you know what this means?" I asked her.

The woman leaned forward to get a closer look, her eyes narrowing as she read the inscription. "It looks like some sort of serial number," she murmured. "Have you tried asking the authorities? They might be able to help you."

I shook my head. "I don't even know where I am, let alone who to ask for help," I admitted, feeling a little lost and overwhelmed.

The woman placed a comforting hand on my shoulder. "Don't worry, we'll figure it out together. Why don't you come with me and we'll see what we can do to help you," she said kindly.

I followed the woman out of the store and into the unknown, hoping to find some answers to the mystery of my identity.

As we walked through the streets, I looked around in wonder, taking in my surroundings. Everything was so new and strange to me, and I couldn't shake off the feeling that I didn't belong here.

The woman noticed my discomfort and smiled reassuringly at me. "Don't worry, we'll find out who you are and where you come from. Everything will be alright," she said softly.

We soon arrived at a royal guard station, and the woman led me inside to speak with an officer. I explained my situation to the soldier, and he listened patiently as I told him everything I knew, including the tattoo on the back of my neck.

The soldier's expression turned serious as he examined the tattoo. "This looks like nothing I've seen before, it looks completely alien," he said, his voice grave.

My heart sank at his words. Was I some sort of experiment, a lab rat being tested on by someone or something? I knew deep down what I was before anyone told me. It was intuition.

The soldier noticed my distress and placed a hand on my shoulder. "Don't worry, we'll figure this out. We'll do everything we can to find out who you are and where you belong," he promised.

Seconds turned into minutes, and minutes turned into hours as the royal guard worked to uncover the mystery of my identity. I was given a place to stay and was looked after by manipulative people who did everything they could to try to make me feel safe and comfortable, but I couldn't for a second trust anyone.

Finally, after several hours of searching, they were able to trace my origins back to a doctor with the last name Genae. As soon as I saw her, violent flashbacks began. She walked towards me with her reptilian smile.

Trying to seem friendly and perhaps calm me down she extended a hand onto my shoulder, "Hi, my name is Dr. Genae. I heard you had some questions about where you might've come from. I work with the military. I may not know exactly what your situation is, but I'd be interested in doing an evaluation, I'm who they call when weird things like this happen."

I recoiled at the touch of her hand, my mind racing with fear and anger at the memories that flooded my mind. I remembered her face, her voice, and the coldness in her eyes. I didn't exactly know where from, but everything in my body was telling me to escape.

"You seem to be upset with me for some reason, but I can't guess why that might be."

I didn't stick around for a chat, I quickly turned around and ran out of the room, pushing past anyone who stood in my way. I knew that I couldn't trust her, that I needed to get as far away from her as possible. So I kept running, my legs pumping furiously as I searched for an exit.

As I sprinted through the corridors, I tried to piece together the memories that were flooding my mind. As I left, I noticed that most of the soldiers were dead. When did this happen? Who exactly was that doctor? My memories were like that of a dream, vague and short lived. 

Finally, I burst through the doors of the royal guard headquarters and into the dark abyss of the starry night outside. Gasping for breath, I collapsed onto the pavement.

As I layed there, I was able to experience the beauty of the night sky in its entirety, a piece of art by God himself.

It was only then that I realized that I was alone, lost in a world that was both unfamiliar and strange. But I knew that I had to keep going, to keep running and searching until I found a place where I belonged. And with that thought in mind, I picked myself up and set off down the street, determined to find my way in this new and trecherous world.

______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The next morning I woke up with bug bites all over, laying down in the middle of grass somwhere. I didn't remember how far I had walked, or where exactly I ended up. Not that I would have known either way. My entire body felt stiff and sore, and although I was awake, I still felt tired enough to go back to sleep. My stomach also ached, potentially from not having had much to eat. 

I looked around, and saw a small town in the distance. It was still early in the morning, and the town appeared to be waking up slowly. I stood up, brushed off the dirt and leaves from my clothes, and started making my way towards the town.

It was small, but bustling with activity. People were going about their day, and I felt almost invisible in the crowd.

All I could think about at the time was food, and so I stumbled across a bakery. 

I looked up at the store clerk with pleading eyes. "Hey sir, could I possibly get some bread, even just one loaf would be enough."

"Unless you got money, I'm afraid I can't help you, I'd love to give you a loaf of bread, but then I'd have to give every starving kid a loaf of bread and soon I'd be out of business."

I felt a bit of tension in my chest, it mightve been anger or hatred, I wasn't sure, but I made sure not to show it. 

"Just one, don't worry I won't tell anyone."

Then things escalated.

"Hey Kid, I already told you, either you got money or you don't, beat it before I call the guards."

This trait, greed, the human quality of constantly wanting more, I could see it in this man. 

Without a second thought I stole an armful of bread, possibly 6 loaves, and started running.

The clerk yells behind me telling to me return, but I had no intention of pausing for a second.

As I ran through the streets with the stolen bread, I felt a rush of adrenaline and a sense of liberation.

Then the unexpected happens, a boy from out of nowhere, takes two of my loaves and start running in a different direction.

As he ran, he laughed, saying, "catch me if you can". 

The boy looked rather poor and young. The fact that my bread was stolen in such a disrespectful manner really upset me.

This time I realized that I too was greedy, just like the clerk.

Feeling conflicted and unsure of how to proceed, I stood idle for a moment as the boy disappeared into the distance with both loaves of bread.

After taking a deep breath, and gathering my thoughts I decided that the best course of action would be to follow the boy and try to reason with him. I knew that I probably had no chance of retrieving the bread, but I hoped that I  could at least connect with him and perhaps understand why he had taken it in the first place.

Perhaps our situations were similar and we could help eachother out.

I quickened my pace and began running after the boy, calling out to him to stop. The crowd was too vast, and keeping track of the boy was nearly impossible. For a moment I had completely lost sight of him.

There were just way too many people in this crowd, hiding in a crowd like this was simply way too easy.

Looking around frantically, I finally spotted an alleyway that I, for some reason, found suspiscious.

When I peaked around the alleyway I saw the boy in front of two men.

"Give us what you have, you know how this works," one of them said.

The boy responds. "Listen fellas, this is all I got for today, I'll get more later, can't I just keep this for now?"

One of the men swiftly punches the boy in the torso, causing him to collapse to the ground with tears in his eyes. He skirmed on the ground for a few moments and somehow could see me peaking around the alleyway. He stared straight at me, his eyes guilting me into helping him.

I stood still for a moment, realizing that the boy had likely fallen into the hands of a group of thieves. I knew I had to act fast if I wanted to rescue him from this dangerous situation.


Taking a deep breath, I stepped into the alleyway and approached the group. "Excuse me," I said firmly. "What's going on here?"

The two men turned to face me, their expressions hostile. "Mind your own business," one of them growled.

But I refused to back down. "That boy has something that belongs to me," I said, hoping to divert their attention away from the boy.

The men looked at me skeptically, but they seemed to be considering my words. In the meantime, I took advantage of the moment and quickly grabbed the boy's hand, pulling him towards me.

"Run!" I yelled, and we both took off, sprinting down the alleyway as fast as we could.

As we ran, I could hear the men shouting and chasing after us, but we managed to outpace them and eventually emerged onto a quieter street. We were both completely out of breath when we stopped. 

As I caught my breath, I glanced at the boy who was also out of breath. He looked at me with a skeptical expression.

"Why did you save me?," he asked sounding almost frustrated.

"Why did you steal from me?", I responded in nearly the same tone.

"I stole in order to surivive, it's as simple as that."

His words hit me, and I suddenly realized that we were more alike than I had initially expected. We were both struggling to make it in a harsh world, doing whatever it took to stay alive. It was the first time I had felt a sense of connection with another individual.

Unknowingly, I still had the majority of the stolen bread cradled in my arms. The boy, who had none of his bread left, looked at the loaves in my arms with pleading eyes.

"Why should I help you? You tried to steal from me, and I just saved you. Isn't that good enough?" I said sarcastically, my frustration evident in my tone.

"Don't be like that," he says.

Without another word, I impulsively hurled a loaf of bread at his face. He caught it just before it hit the ground, a grateful smile spreading across his face. "Thanks," he said.

We both found a spot on the ground to sit and eat our bread, our hunger evident in our voracious bites. Our thin frames were a testament to our prolonged lack of food.

When I look up for the first time in a while, I find out the boy is staring at me. He continues to stare at me for an uncomfortable amount of time.

"What are you looking at?" I asked, my guard up.

"Ive never seen anyone as beautiful as you. The color of your hair, the way your eyes glow, and your features..."

I interrupted him. "Well I gave you what you wanted, you can go now."

"Wow you're cold. Can't we just talk for a minute?"

I couldn't bring myself to stay, the vulnerability of the situation made me uneasy. I got up abruptly and started walking away, my emotions swirling inside me.

As I walked away he asked me a question that completely stopped me in my tracks. "You have any parents?"

I stopped walking, my back turned to him. "I don't know, I don't remember."

"Yeah, neither do I," he said, his tone somber. "I'm an orphan. My parents supposedly died when I was too young to remember."

I sighed, feeling a pang of irritation. "That's not what I meant," I explained impatiently. "It's different for me. It's as if my life started yesterday. I don't remember anything at all."

"Well, that doesn't make any sense. Maybe you were in some sort of accident, and got amnesia from it.

"But wouldn't I have been noticeably injured?" I countered, struggling to understand my own situation. It was frustrating to be surrounded by so many unanswered questions about my past.

I turned around to face him. "That's what puzzles me," I said. "I don't have any scars or injuries that would indicate an accident or trauma. It's like my past was wiped clean."

He looked at me sympathetically, his earlier flirtatious demeanor replaced with genuine concern. "That must be tough," he said softly. "Not knowing who you are or where you come from."

He reached out a hand towards me, hesitating for a moment before placing it on my shoulder in a comforting gesture. "You're stronger than you think," he said earnestly. "And you're not alone anymore. I'm here."

I gave him a small nod of appreciation, acknowledging his words. "Thanks," I said quietly. "I appreciate that."

He smiled warmly, and we sat down together on the curb, sharing the remaining bread in companionable silence.

Despite our differences and the circumstances that brought us together, there was a warmth in our friendship that brought a much-needed light to the darkness and uncertainty of my lonely existence.

"You know," he said with a small smile, "we may not have all the answers right now, but at least we have each other."

For the first time in a long time, I felt a glimmer of hope that maybe, just maybe, I could find some answers to my past and forge a new future with this unlikely ally by my side.

"I don't think I got your name, mine is Mikaelle. What's yours?" he asked.

The question caught me off guard. I hadn't really thought about having a name before. In the haze of my recent memories, my name seemed inconsequential, and I couldn't remember if I had one.

"I don't have a name, I said, I can't remember."

"Oh, that's right," he said, seemingly unfazed by my response.

"Well, I'll call you Red, because you have really red hair."

Did I really? I had only seen my reflection once, and it didn't seem that red to me at the time, perhaps my reflection was distorted.

"I don't think I've ever seen hair that red before, it almost looks dyed," he remarked, getting closer to my face and reaching out to touch my hair.

I instinctively smacked his hand away. "Don't touch me," I snapped.

He quickly withdrew his hand, looking apologetic. "Oh, sorry," he said.

There was a brief pause before he asked his next question. "So, where do you live?" he inquired.

"I've been sleeping in the grass," I replied, feeling a little self-conscious about my dirty appearance.

"No wonder you're covered in dirt," he remarked with a chuckle.

He then mentioned that he lived in a tent that he had found years ago. He led me to his makeshift home and proudly showed me all of his belongings, which seemed to be a mix of random items that he had likely scavenged or stolen.

As we talked, he mentioned that he had heard stories about mystical and dangerous creatures that supposedly inhabited the forest nearby. I scoffed at the idea, not believing in such tales.

I couldn't help but be impressed by his collection. Some of the items intrigued me, and I reached out to touch them, but he quickly pulled them away, looking protective.

Mikaelle's appearance may not have been conventionally attractive, but there was something about his candidness and disregard for societal norms that I could strangely relate to. Maybe I didn't find theft or dishonesty as abhorrent as I should have.

"You can stay here too, you know," he said, looking into my eyes.

"Nah, I think I'm going to venture off on my own," I replied.

I extended my hand for a handshake, and he took it. But then, unexpectedly, he pulled me into a hug. It felt awkward, yet oddly comforting, I couldn't quite desrcibe it with words, but just like before, I felt the urge to leave immediately.

"Well, I better get going," I said, pulling away.

I walked off in a random direction, and instead of sleeping in the grass like before, I found myself settling for an alleyway for the night.

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I woke up in a bed, disoriented and completely unaware of my surroundings. As I left the room, I saw a woman sitting in a kitchen, sipping coffee. She seemed oblivious to my presence.

"Where am I?" I asked.

"I found you in an alleyway," she replied. "I brought you inside to get you away from the bugs. This isn't a safe area for a girl to be alone. This is Lithia afterall."

This was the first I had heard the name of the city outright.

Altruism was a concept I struggled to understand, and something I couldn't trust. I knew why Mikaelle offered to help me; I not only saved him from a dangerous situation, but gave him my food. He was merely expressing gratitude. Maybe there was more to it than that aswell, but I didn't really want to think about it.

But this woman, she perplexed me. I couldn't make sense of her kindness.

When the woman turned away, I couldn't resist the urge to take a few things from her house before leaving. I didn't feel guilty or attached to her in any way. To me, she was just a person who had naively trusted a stranger on the streets, and this was the consequence.

Stepping outside, I realized I had no idea where I was. My initial instinct was to find Mikaelle, but hunger gnawed at my stomach. The bread I ate the day prior had only momentarily satisfied my hunger.

I decided to steal some food, enough to share with Mikaelle if I ever found him.

Remembering back to how big Mikaelle's collection was, I wondered if I could steal something valuable aswell.

As I wandered through the city, my eyes scanned the shops for potential targets. I was surrounded by poverty-stricken individuals, except for the merchants. I wondered who I could steal from to obtain something valuable.

After some time, I spotted a leather jacket in one of the shops. When the merchant was momentarily distracted, I seized the opportunity and snatched the jacket. The rush of adrenaline was palpable, but I felt far less guilt compared to stealing food, and only a hint of fear.

My eyes then fell upon a woman who was loudly complaining about a merchant's pricing tactics. She wore a bracelet that caught my eye. I approached her with a smile, pretending to console her about the situation.

"What seems to be the issue?" I asked.

The woman went on about how the merchant was trying to upsell her on something. As she continued to vent, I casually placed my hand on her shoulder, all the while using my other hand to deftly remove the bracelet.

It was a classic pickpocket move, and I had no idea where I had learned it. As I walked away, I could sense that the woman had noticed her missing bracelet.

"Hey, that girl stole my bracelet!" she shouted.

I picked up my pace, blending into the crowded streets, feeling a mix of exhilaration and guilt. I knew I had to find Mikaelle soon and share my spoils with him. Perhaps he would have something to say about my newfound skills and my ambiguous morality.

It seemed like  everyone was looking for me now. I could see poeople in the streets looking at me. And the woman along with two men were on a horse, and they had completely caught up with me.

As I frantically tried to evade capture, the woman and the two men quickly closed in on me. I realized there was no use in running, as I couldn't possibly outrun a horse. Desperation set in as I sought refuge in an alleyway, concealing myself behind some debris. But to my horror, they seemed to know exactly where I was, and the footsteps grew louder as they approached.

This was bad.

Within moments, the woman and the two men found me, surrounding me on all sides. I could feel their eyes on me, and the woman's voice was filled with anger as she spoke.

"Hold her. You don't steal from me, you understand me?" she demanded, her tone sharp and unforgiving.

I was trapped, outnumbered and defenseless. My heart pounded in my chest as I looked at the three of them, feeling a mix of fear and defiance. I knew I might've crossed a line by stealing from the woman, but I wasn't ready to give up without a fight.

"I don't answer to anyone," I retorted, my voice tinged with defiance. "Let me go, or you'll regret it."

This confidence seemed to come from nowhere. The situation was dire, but I couldn't seem to let myself show any sign of weakness.

The woman's eyes narrowed, and I could see the determination in her gaze. The two men tightened their grip on me, making it clear that escape was not an option. I braced myself, uncertain of what would happen next, but unwilling to back down.

Unexpectedly the woman struck me in the stomach, without pulling her punch. It completely knocked the wind out of me, and I found myself momentarily gasping for air.

"Take her jacket. Infact, take her clothes too, leave her with nothing." the woman demanded.

The two men hesitated, seemingly conflicted by the woman's orders. They exchanged uneasy glances, as if unsure about the ethical implications of stripping me of my belongings. The men argued with her, saying it was ethically wrong and too severe a punishment.

"How much am I paying you? Do what I say!" the woman snapped, her impatience evident.

No mattter how much I struggled I couldn't seem to get free.

They both gripped each of my arms with both of theirs, it was completely hopeless to try to escape.

My thoughts turned to Mikaelle, and I wondered if he could help me get out of this predicament.

Then I heard a familiar voice. It was him.

Mikaelle appeared suddenly, wearing a mask and with his arm around the woman, brandishing a knife.

"If you don't let her go right now, I'll kill her!" Mikaelle's voice rang out, filled with a mix of determination and fear.

The two men's grip on my arms loosened, and their attention was diverted to Mikaelle. The woman pushed Mikaelle's arm away and swiftly kneed him in the stomach, causing him to double over in pain. She then grabbed him by the hair, lifting him up after kicking his feet out from under him.

"We got a hero, huh? What's this, your girlfriend?" the woman sneered, noticing our close proximity.

The knife fell from Mikaelle's hand and clattered to the ground. The woman picked it up, pressing it against Mikaelle's neck, causing the men to hesitate, their attention now solely on the boy.

This was my chance to act. Both my arms were free. I rushed the woman, grabbed the wrist holding the knife, and twisted it as hard as I could. I heard a crackle and a pop, which meant that I likely fractured it. She yelled out in pain. The knife once again fell to the ground, but was picked up by me this time.

I held the knife out in front me of me.

The men were at a safe distance, with no desire to get stabbed. Mikaelle was on the ground, still recovering from being kneed in the stomach.

"Think about it guys, you really want to die over a stolen bracelet? Is it really worth your lives?" I said.

"What're you doing, just take her, she's a little girl, so what she has a knife, you're two grown men!" yelled the woman furiously.

One of the men tried approaching me, but I immediately struck him in the arm. He winced with pain as blood streamed down his shoulder.

"This isn't just some random kid, she somehow knows how to use that knife." one of the men said.

"Is this really what I hired you for? To be afraid of some poor insolent pathetic excuse for a girl? Forget it! I'll deal with her myself."

The woman tries to approach too quickly and get's struck in the chest by the knife.

The movement seemed to happen almost unconsciously, completely instinctually, it was if I had done it a thousand times before.

The men left. And we were left there with the woman on the ground dead.
